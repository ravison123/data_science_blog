Hi, I’m Ravindra. I’m passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Generative AI, and I believe, as Andrew Ng says, "AI is the new electricity." This blog focuses on the practical side of these fields—how to use data and AI to solve real-world problems and drive impact. Join me as I explore hands-on projects, share insights, and dive into the tools and techniques shaping the future.
